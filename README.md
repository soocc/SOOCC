About my channel (Youtube SEO):
Hello, my name is soocc and welcome to my channel!
I am a youtuber who occasionally records videos on different versions of minecraft such as 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 1.10, 1.11, 1.12, 1.13, 1.14, 1.15, 1.16, 1.17, 1.18, or 1.19.
I usually do videos on PvP duels or fights, and also 1v1s. Currently, my favorite launcher is Lunar Client, because it gives an fps boost through lazy chunk loading and other optimizations. I play on a render distance of 2 because I play on a macbook and I need good performance.
I usually butterfly click in duels because it gives me the most aim. However, I occasionally jitter in sumo because my mouse doesn't double click, which means that I can get more clicks per second from jittering. I want to learn other clicking methods like drag clicking in the future. I find clicking methods like toe clicking or lip clicking hillarious.
I aspire to be a youtuber like Stimpy (Marcel), Technoblade, Telly, BedlessNoob, MrBeast, Skeppy, AreUMadLoL, Ziblacking, Refraction, or PewDiePie.
I like playing on minecraft servers like Minemen Club, Hypixel, Lunar, Jartex Network, and Kohi.
